### Magic Quote Generator

This project is a Magic Quote Generator app that fetches quotes from an open API and displays random quotes on the screen. It also allows signed-in users to save their own quotes, which are displayed in a separate list. The application does not use a database to store users and quotes; instead, their data is saved in local storage. The project utilizes React hooks to handle and display the quote data.
